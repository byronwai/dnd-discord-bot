# D&D DM Bot — v4 Engine-Driven

Self-hosted Dungeon Master for Discord. **Game engine does 70%** (rules,
state, combat, dice); **LLM does 30%** (reading player intent, writing
prose). The game is fully playable without any LLM.

## Architecture

                        skeleton prose  polish + flavour  #dnd-health
                        (no LLM)        (s2t + guards)    log stream
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# GB10 (or any box with Ollama)
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # fill DISCORD_TOKEN, LLM_URL, V4_CHANNEL_ID
python bot.py

# no-LLM test (proves the engine works standalone)
python v4/cli.py selftest

# interactive CLI (zero LLM)
python v4/cli.py
```

## Commands (24: 15 player + 9 admin)

| Player | Admin |
|---|---|
| `/pc name occupation` — create character | `/explore-admin text char` |
| `/explore <text>` — freeform action | `/attack-admin char target move` |
| `/confirm` — confirm pending action | `/use-admin char item on` |
| `/attack [target] [move]` — typed combat family | `/skill-admin char skill on` |
| `/use [item] [on]` — item / feed a DOWNED ally | `/defend-admin` `/flee-admin` |
| `/skill [skill] [on]` — 18 skills ★, context targets | `/observe-admin char target` |
| `/defend` `/flee` `/observe [target]` | `/roll-admin expr char` |
| `/inventory` — items + slots + skills + moves | `/give-admin char item qty` |
| `/roll [expr]` — dice (settles checks, auto-continues) | |
| `/give item [to]` — transfer; no recipient = set down | |
| `/status` — party + scene + disclosed intel | |
| `/continue` — finish unfinished narration, else unstuck | |
| `/help` | |

Every combat command has its own typed autocomplete (enemy HP,
item quantities, ★-proficient skills, downed-ally markers) — one
command per action instead of one polymorphic menu.

**In-channel keywords** (instant, no LLM): `status` `inv` `moves` `scene`

**Plain text** = table talk (silently ignored, no reaction, no reply)

## The 18 Skills

All SRD skills are wired into the engine (defined in `engine/charlib.py`,
proficiency per class in `CORE_SKILLS`). Describe the action in `/explore`
— 匿埋（潛行）、嚇佢（恐嚇）、包紮（醫藥）、爬牆（運動）— or pick from
`/combat` → ✨技能 (★ = proficient). Engine effects on success:
stealth → next attack with advantage · insight → read an NPC's true
attitude · medicine → revive a downed ally · perception/investigation →
find hidden items · social skills → move NPC disposition up the ladder.
`/inventory` shows each character's full skill sheet.

## Design Principles

1. **Engine decides, model narrates** — the LLM has no write path to game
   state; it reads facts and writes prose
2. **Predict the narration** — the engine renders prose skeletons from its
   own data; the narrator only adds atmosphere
3. **NPC knowledge is data** — each NPC has a `knows` list; the narrator
   can only reveal those facts
4. **No LLM required** — the CLI proves the full game (combat, items,
   scenes, checks) works with zero model calls
5. **v3 lessons ported** — placeholder names, fake-dice scrubbing,
   repetition guard, language enforcement, input sanitization

## Models

| Role | Model | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Digestor | gemma3:12b-it-qat | Player text → Intent JSON |
| Narrator | gemma3:27b-it-qat | Facts → prose (80–160 字) |

Both optional — game runs without them.
